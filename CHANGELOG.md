# Changelog

User-visible changes to Harmonist, newest first — read this on upgrade.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com);
versions follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Sync Bandcamp is disabled on the Settings page, where it would have read
  settings you're partway through changing (#108).
- The sync options popover no longer opens over a disabled Sync button — during
  the first library scan its "Sync with these options" started a sync anyway
  (#110).
- Syncing is refused while the first library scan is still running (#110).

### Added

- Albums now have their own page at `/album/<id>`, with the full tracklist and
  everything Harmonist has recorded about them — including from before the album
  was last re-identified (#103).
- Clicking a library tile still opens a summary; it answers "is this the right
  release?" and links through to the page for the tracklist and actions (#103).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Starting a sync writes one Activity entry instead of two, and says whether it's
  link-only or full; a reconcile with nothing to do stays quiet (#101).
- Demo mode no longer says an album has no matching Bandcamp purchase before
  you've synced (#87).
- The header status message no longer flickers (#93).
- The Activity tab no longer flickers while it's open (#91).

### Added

- Activity entries expand to show exactly what Harmonist changed on disk (#84).
- Tagging, erasing sidecars, surrendering an album and saving cover art are now
  recorded in the audit log (#88).
- The Activity feed pages back through older history, with a "Technical detail"
  toggle for the raw audit records (#14).
- Downloads, purchase links and possible mis-tags now name and link their album,
  like the rest of the feed (#97).
- Audit records show paths relative to your music library rather than in full
  (#98).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-02

### Upgrading

- **Nothing to do** about `ignores.txt` — existing entries keep working. Choices
  made before this release sit below the file's separator line, so they won't
  appear in the new "Won't download" list; move a line above the separator if you
  want it listed. **Don't delete the file:** albums you've downloaded are
  recognised from their sidecars, but a "Don't download" choice exists nowhere
  else, and removing it lets the purchase download again.

### Added

- Settings lists the purchases you told Harmonist not to download, with a Restore
  button — an ignore is no longer a one-way door (#19).
- Activity entries written by a sync or auto-reconcile now name and link their
  album too (#75).

### Fixed

- "Don't download" is recorded in the user section of `ignores.txt`, so the
  choice can't be mistaken for an already-downloaded album or lost mid-sync (#77).
- Deciding the same purchase twice no longer duplicates a line in `ignores.txt`
  (#79).
- Demo mode no longer writes to your real `ignores.txt` (#77).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Activity entries name their album and link to it, at a URL you can bookmark or
  share (#65).
- The activity feed and audit records persist across restarts, in a SQLite store
  in the config dir (#33).

### Fixed

- Links to an album keep working after Harmonist re-identifies it — tagging it,
  or correcting its MusicBrainz match (#33).
- The "that album isn't in your library any more" notice can be dismissed, and no
  longer reappears on refresh (#71).
- Demo mode no longer writes into your real activity history, or logs a start-up
  error opening the activity database (#69).
- A store URL is recognised only when its *host* is the store's domain, so a
  lookalike like `notbandcamp.com` is no longer accepted (#63).
- Shutting down mid-reconcile no longer logs a spurious "Event loop is closed"
  error (#52).
- Linking a potential download from the "Verify album" dialog now actually links
  it; modals use the native `<dialog>` element (#53).
- "Move to Library" no longer flickers the inbox (#11).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- The library "verify tagging" view now flags tracks whose on-disk title differs
  from MusicBrainz: the header reports the count instead of claiming "exact match",
  and the differing rows are highlighted.
- You can now correct a wrong MusicBrainz match on a Library album — a pencil beside
  the MusicBrainz badge (in the album detail) sends it back to Needs MBID so you can
  pick the right release and re-tag. Your files keep their tags until you do.

### Changed

- The disk-vs-MusicBrainz length Δ column now shows whole seconds, and a
  within-tolerance difference is muted (the lengths are effectively the same) while
  an over-tolerance difference stays highlighted.
- The ambiguous "Wrong match" button in the album detail is gone. Correcting a wrong
  MusicBrainz release is now a pencil beside the MusicBrainz badge (see Added). The
  Bandcamp link-removal controls (the old "Wrong match" and "Unlink") are temporarily
  removed until a Library album can be re-linked to a purchase.

### Fixed

- Album-detail actions that close the modal now actually perform their action.
  Previously the modal closed before the request could fire, so the control did
  nothing.
- Manual "Re-tag from MB" now shows a progress spinner while it runs and refreshes
  the album details view when it finishes, so the disk-vs-MusicBrainz comparison
  reflects the just-written tags without reopening the album.
- Re-tagging from MusicBrainz now writes the per-release track title, not the
  underlying recording title. Track titles edited on a release (e.g. cleaning up a
  featured-artist credit) are picked up on re-tag instead of silently keeping the
  old name.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-10

- Initial release.
